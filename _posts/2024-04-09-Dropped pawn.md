Some days ago I was watching a chess game and took note of a nice position that came up. Later that day, I came across my young sister.

"Elva", I said to her, "look at this board from today's game. How odd it is!"; to which she answered, sharp as always, "It doesn't seem to have lasted long. Mate in one.". Didn't even blink!

Below's the board that I showed Elva. A pawn is missing (but only from the board below, i.e. Elva saw the complete board).
